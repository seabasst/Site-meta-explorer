# Phase 17.2: Dead Code Cleanup Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Remove orphaned MediaTypeChart and ResultsTable components that are exported but never imported
**Verified:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | MediaTypeChart component file no longer exists in the codebase | VERIFIED | `ls src/components/demographics/media-type-chart.tsx` returns "No such file or directory" |
| 2 | ResultsTable component file no longer exists in the codebase | VERIFIED | `ls src/components/results-table.tsx` returns "No such file or directory" |
| 3 | No orphaned component exports remain from Phase 15/17 work | VERIFIED | `grep -r "MediaTypeChart\|ResultsTable\|media-type-chart\|results-table" src/` returns zero matches |
| 4 | Application builds successfully after deletion | VERIFIED | `npm run build` exits with code 0 |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

This phase is a deletion phase -- success means artifacts do NOT exist.

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `src/components/demographics/media-type-chart.tsx` | DELETED | VERIFIED DELETED | File does not exist on filesystem |
| `src/components/results-table.tsx` | DELETED | VERIFIED DELETED | File does not exist on filesystem |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| Any src/ file | MediaTypeChart | import | VERIFIED CLEAN | Zero references in src/ |
| Any src/ file | ResultsTable | import | VERIFIED CLEAN | Zero references in src/ |

### Git Evidence

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Deletion commit exists | `6cb361f refactor(17.2-01): delete orphaned MediaTypeChart and ResultsTable components` |
| Phase plan committed | `14a7301 docs(17.2): create phase plan for dead code cleanup` |
| Phase summary committed | `ee76175 docs(17.2-01): complete dead code cleanup plan` |

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. This is a clean deletion phase with no new code introduced.

### Human Verification Required

None. All checks are programmatically verifiable for a deletion phase.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All four must-haves verified against the actual codebase. Both orphaned files are confirmed deleted, no dangling references exist, and the application builds cleanly.
