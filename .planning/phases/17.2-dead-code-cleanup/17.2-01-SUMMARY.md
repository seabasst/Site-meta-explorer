# Phase 17.2 Plan 01: Dead Code Cleanup Summary

**One-liner:** Deleted orphaned MediaTypeChart (140 lines) and ResultsTable (458 lines) that were exported but never imported anywhere.

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Delete orphaned component files
- **Commit:** `6cb361f`
- Deleted `src/components/demographics/media-type-chart.tsx` (140 lines) - MediaTypeChart component with Phase 15 tooltip and click-to-filter work that was never rendered
- Deleted `src/components/results-table.tsx` (458 lines) - ResultsTable component with Phase 17-02 mobile responsive work (horizontal scroll, touch-friendly copy buttons) that was never rendered
- Verified zero references remain in codebase via grep
- Build passes cleanly

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| media-type-chart.tsx deleted | Pass |
| results-table.tsx deleted | Pass |
| No dangling references (grep) | Pass - zero matches |
| npm run build | Pass - exit 0 |

## Impact

- **597 lines removed** from the codebase
- Eliminates maintenance burden on components that were never rendered
- Phase 15/17 work on these files (tooltips, click-to-filter, mobile responsive tables) was confirmed dead code
- No user-visible change (components were never imported)

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 17.2 complete. v2.1 gap closure phases (14-17.2) are all done. Project is ready for v3.0 (Phases 18-23) when planned.
