<objective>
Delete orphaned MediaTypeChart and ResultsTable components that are exported but never imported anywhere.

Purpose: These files accumulated work from Phases 15 and 17 (tooltips, click-to-filter, mobile responsive tables) that has zero user-visible effect because the components are never rendered. Removing them eliminates confusion and dead maintenance burden.

Output: Two fewer files in the codebase, clean build confirming nothing depended on them.

  <name>Task 1: Delete orphaned component files</name>
  <files>
    src/components/demographics/media-type-chart.tsx
    src/components/results-table.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Delete the following two files:

    1. `src/components/demographics/media-type-chart.tsx` — MediaTypeChart component with 140 lines. Exported but never imported. Page.tsx uses inline stat card buttons for media type display instead. Phase 15 tooltip and click-to-filter work on this file has zero user-visible effect.

    2. `src/components/results-table.tsx` — ResultsTable component with 458 lines. Exported but never imported. Page.tsx has its own inline ad table. Phase 17-02 mobile responsive work on this file (horizontal scroll, touch-friendly copy buttons) is never rendered.

    After deletion, run a full grep across `src/` for any references to these files or their exports (MediaTypeChart, ResultsTable, media-type-chart, results-table) to confirm nothing references them. There should be zero matches.

    Then run `npm run build` to confirm the application compiles cleanly without these files.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. `ls src/components/demographics/media-type-chart.tsx` returns "No such file"
    2. `ls src/components/results-table.tsx` returns "No such file"
    3. `grep -r "MediaTypeChart\|ResultsTable\|media-type-chart\|results-table" src/` returns no matches
    4. `npm run build` succeeds with exit code 0
  </verify>
  <done>
    Both orphaned component files are deleted. Build passes. No dangling references exist anywhere in the codebase.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `find src/ -name "media-type-chart*" -o -name "results-table*"` returns nothing
- `npm run build` exits 0
- `grep -r "MediaTypeChart\|ResultsTable" src/` returns no matches
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. MediaTypeChart component file is removed from the codebase
2. ResultsTable component file is removed from the codebase
3. No orphaned exports remain from Phase 15/17 work
4. Application builds and runs without errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/17.2-dead-code-cleanup/17.2-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
