# Milestone v1.0: Ad Library Demographics Analyzer

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-25
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 10

## Overview

This roadmap delivered demographic extraction and aggregation capabilities for Facebook Ad Library analysis. Phases followed natural dependencies: foundation upgrades enabled reliable scraping, extraction pulled per-ad data, aggregation combined it meaningfully, and display presented results to users. All 12 v1 requirements mapped to exactly one phase.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal:** Scraping infrastructure is upgraded for reliable, undetected operation
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements:** RELY-01
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Upgrade to rebrowser-puppeteer-core via npm aliasing

**Success Criteria:**
1. Scraper uses rebrowser-puppeteer-core instead of puppeteer-core
2. Existing ad discovery functionality continues to work after upgrade
3. No detection/blocking observed during normal scraping operations

**Completed:** 2026-01-18

### Phase 2: Demographic Extraction

**Goal:** Users get per-ad demographic data from top-performing ads
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Requirements:** EXTR-01, EXTR-02, EXTR-03, RELY-02, RELY-04
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md - Types and top performer selection
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md - Demographic extraction parser
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md - Navigation and orchestration
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md - API layer wiring (gap closure)

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can see age group percentages extracted from ad detail pages
2. User can see gender percentages extracted from ad detail pages
3. User can see country/region distribution extracted from ad detail pages
4. Top-performing ads (by reach or duration) are automatically selected for analysis
5. When demographic data is unavailable for an ad, scraping continues with remaining ads

**Completed:** 2026-01-19

### Phase 3: Aggregation

**Goal:** Per-ad demographic data is combined into meaningful weighted summaries
**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Requirements:** EXTR-04
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md - Aggregation module (types and pure functions)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md - Integration and verification

**Success Criteria:**
1. Demographics are weighted by reach/impressions, not just ad count
2. Aggregated summary reflects contribution of high-reach ads more than low-reach ads
3. Aggregation handles missing data gracefully (ads without reach data still contribute)

**Completed:** 2026-01-19

---

### Phase 4: Display

**Goal:** Users can view and understand aggregated demographic insights
**Depends on:** Phase 3
**Requirements:** DISP-01, DISP-02, DISP-03, DISP-04, RELY-03
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - Install Recharts, create config input
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md - Create chart and summary components
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md - Integrate components into main page

**Success Criteria:**
1. User sees text summary of demographics (e.g., "55% female, 60% ages 25-44")
2. User sees age/gender breakdown as visual chart
3. User sees country distribution as visual chart
4. User sees loading progress during demographic scraping
5. User can configure how many ads to analyze before starting scrape

**Completed:** 2026-01-25

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | npm aliasing for rebrowser | Zero source code changes, transparent package swap |
| 02-01 | Reach over duration for top performer sorting | Higher-reach ads contribute more to weighted aggregation |
| 02-02 | Recursive traversal for JSON parsing | Flexible approach handles any structure |
| 02-03 | Random 1-3s delays between requests | Avoid detection from rapid sequential requests |
| 03-01 | Default weight of 1 for ads without reach | Ensures all ads contribute to aggregation |
| 04-03 | Use facebook-ads API instead of scrape-ads | EU DSA data provides demographics directly; more reliable |
| 04-03 | Vertical chart layout | Better readability on all screen sizes |

**Issues Resolved:**

- Implemented Facebook Graph API integration for EU DSA transparency data
- Created weighted demographic aggregation by reach
- Built visual charts with Recharts (age/gender, country distribution)

**Technical Debt Addressed:**

- Removed orphaned Puppeteer scraping code (2,034 lines deleted)
- Removed unused packages (rebrowser-puppeteer-core, @sparticuz/chromium-min)
