## E2E Flow Verification

| Ad preview on mobile (view cards → see badges → tap to open Facebook) | COMPLETE |

**Score: 3/3 flows fully complete**

## Gap Closure History

The initial audit (2026-02-01 pre-17.1) identified 5 issues. All resolved:

| Original Issue | Resolution |
|----------------|------------|
| Filtered ad table in PDF | Phase 17.1: `isExporting ? apiResult.ads : filteredAds` at page.tsx L1517 |
| No mobile export progress | Phase 17.1: Progress text rendered on Export button, not just in dropdown |
| Country chart tooltip overflow on 375px | Phase 17.1: `left-20 sm:left-36` aligns with `w-20 sm:w-36` label column |
| Orphaned MediaTypeChart component | Phase 17.2: File deleted, zero references remain |
| Orphaned ResultsTable component | Phase 17.2: File deleted, zero references remain |

## Tech Debt

None. All items from initial audit resolved by gap closure phases.
